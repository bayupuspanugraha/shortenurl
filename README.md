# Shorten URL

## Explanation

This project focused on how to create simple API which allowing user to shorten their url. The basic concept of this API is trying to generate new URL with smaller unique id (we are using nanoid generator).

For example:

- Given URL input : https://google.com
- Then the short URL : http://localhost:[port]/go/[uniqueId]

If user access the short url, it will lead to the same url as the original.

I made real implementation by using several language programming, such as: **go, python, js, .net core, java and php**. There's several endpoint API which you can see from the root **'/'** for entire list endpoint such as **GET '/info'**, **GET '/go/[uniqueId]'** and **POST '/shortenurl'**.

- [Javascript](./js)
- [Golang](./go)
- [CSharp](./csharp)
- [Python](./python)
- [PHP](./php)
- [Java](./java)
